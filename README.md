Hi! If you can see this, chances are, you are involved in the website development.


# What are we using for dev?

Basically plain MERN, for now.

## "I don't know how to run the react build scripts!"
### Here's what you need to keep a track of:
`npm start` Starts the development server.

`npm run build` Bundles the app into static files for production.

`npm test` Starts the test runner.

`npm run eject` Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

This will only work in the cloned directory.

## Where is the scrum board?
